<!-- Instructions: Guess a Letter -->

<body>
    <!-- script start tages for Java Script -->
        <!-- add extermal scrtip via <script src____> -->

<!-- Structure of page should look like this for the use -->
    <!-- blanks for leters in word -->
    <!-- Number of guesses available that decreases with each guess-->
    <!-- Letters that have been guessed  -->
    <!-- Number of Wins - Words solved correctly -->
    <!-- Number of Losses - Words solved incorrectly -->
    <!-- Words successful won -->

<!-- functionality and flow of whole game -->
            <!-- START GAME: -->
            <!-- generate random word (math.random) from array -->
                <!-- have blanks correspond to # of letters in that randomly generated word word via varvalue.length-->
                    <!-- need loop to pull from an array and push data to page -->
            <!--Checking letters with true/false (if/else) function -->
                <!-- if letter is true push letter to blank and reduce # of available guesses to continue-->
                <!-- else laeve blank empty, reduce # of available guesses and push letter to "letters guessed" array -->
            <!-- END GAME: -->
                <!-- Game ends when number of guesses has been reached or if word has been guessed -->
                <!-- use if/else to alert user of outcome -->
                    <!-- if word guess correctly within alotted # of guesses parameter -- YOU WIN!-- increment # of wins -->
                    <!-- if word not guessed and # of available guesses has expired -- NO MORE GUESSES, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! -- increment # of losses -->
            <!-- RESET -->
                 <!-- Reset blanks after end of previous game -->
                <!-- reset # of available guesses to total -->
                <!-- reset letters to guess to include full alphabet-->


<!-- game start function -->
            <!-- responds to user pressing letter on release (onkeyup) -->
            <!-- takes letter and puts it in a var array of used letters  -->
            <!-- once number of allotted guesses have been used game alerts user to win or try again and rgame resets -->



<!-- letter checking function -->
            <!-- pulls/loops letters from selected word in array for the number of letters in that word -->
            <!-- reduces number of available guesses via decrement -->
            <!-- if letter matches one of the letters in word it pulls the letter into the blank (true) -->
            <!-- if letter does not match blank remains blank (false) and letter gets moved into letters guessed-->


<!-- finish round function -->
        <!-- !-- Game ends when number of guesses has been reached or if word has been guessed --> -->
            <!-- use if/else to alert user of outcome -->
                <!-- if word guess correctly within alotted # of guesses parameter -- YOU WIN!-- increment # of wins -->
                <!-- if word not guessed and # of available guesses has expired -- NO MORE GUESSES, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! -- increment # of losses -->


                <!-- RESET -->
 <!-- Reset blanks after end of previous game -->
<!-- reset # of available guesses to total -->
<!-- reset letters to guess to include full alphabet-->
