<!-- functionality and flow of whole game -->

             <!-- generate random word (math.random) from array -->                 <!-- have blanks correspond to # of letters in that randomly generated word word via varvalue.length-->
                     <!-- need loop to pull from an array and push data to page -->             <!--Checking letters with true/false (if/else) function -->
                <!-- if letter is true push letter to blank and reduce # of available guesses to continue-->
                 <!-- else laeve blank empty, reduce # of available guesses and push letter to "letters guessed" array -->
             <!-- END GAME: -->
                 <!-- Game ends when number of guesses has been reached or if word has been guessed -->
                 <!-- use if/else to alert user of outcome -->
                     <!-- if word guess correctly within alotted # of guesses parameter -- YOU WIN!-- increment # of wins -->
                     <!-- if word not guessed and # of available guesses has expired -- NO MORE GUESSES, PLEASE TRY AGAIN! -- increment # of losses -->

                 <!-- reset # of available guesses to total -->
                 <!-- reset letters to guess to include full alphabet-->


<!-- game start function -->
             <!-- responds to user pressing letter on release (onkeyup) -->
             <!-- takes letter and puts it in a var array of used letters  -->
             <!-- once number of allotted guesses have been used game alerts user to win or try again and game resets -->



<!-- letter checking function -->
             <!-- pulls/loops letters from selected word in array for the number of letters in that word -->
          <!-- reduces number of available guesses via decrement -->
          <!-- if letter matches one of the letters in word it pulls the letter into the blank (true) -->             <!-- if letter does not match blank remains blank (false) and letter gets moved into letters guessed-->
